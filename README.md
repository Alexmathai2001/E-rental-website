# Torq v0.1


Torq is an E-rental web application designed to address the issue of spending substantial sums on purchasing machinery, even for minor or domestic use cases. The platform acts as a bridge between renters and users, providing an easy way for users to discover suitable power tools or machinery tailored to their specific needs. Users can efficiently rent these products for a designated time period, enabling them to save significant amounts of money that would otherwise be spent on purchasing the same items outright.
